            <h1>Evaluation of Learning and Professional Development</h1>
          </header>

          <p>This section provides an evaluation of my learning experience throughout the Security and Risk Management module. It focuses on my key strengths, areas for improvement, and how this learning has contributed to my professional development within cybersecurity.</p>

          <h2>Key Strengths</h2>
          <p>Throughout the module, I demonstrated a strong understanding of cybersecurity risk frameworks such as <strong>ISO 31000</strong> and the <strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)</strong>. I successfully applied these models to real-world business contexts, particularly in the Pampered Pets case study, where I helped identify and categorise organisational risks.</p>
          <p>I also developed analytical skills by applying quantitative tools such as the <strong>Probability-Impact Matrix (PIM)</strong> and <strong>Expected Monetary Value (EMV)</strong>. These tools allowed for clear prioritisation of risks based on their potential business impact. Additionally, I strengthened my collaboration and communication skills through effective teamwork and the production of structured documentation.</p>

          <h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>
          <p>One area that requires improvement is the <strong>depth of critical analysis</strong> when applying theoretical frameworks. While I effectively identified and mitigated risks, my discussion could have benefited from a broader comparison of frameworks such as <strong>OCTAVE</strong> or <strong>FAIR</strong> to enhance justification of choices. Furthermore, I aim to improve my evaluation of mitigation strategies, particularly in explaining how performance indicators (KPIs) would be monitored or measured in practice.</p>

          <h2>Professional Development</h2>
          <p>This module has significantly contributed to my professional growth. I have enhanced my ability to analyse, quantify, and manage risk within a cybersecurity context, and I now possess a clearer understanding of governance and compliance processes. These skills directly support my ambition to become a <strong>Cybersecurity Analyst</strong> or <strong>Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) Specialist</strong>.</p>
          <p>The module has also motivated me to pursue profess
