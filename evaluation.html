            <h1>Evaluation of Learning and Professional Development</h1>
          </header>

          <p>
            This evaluation provides an overview of my learning throughout the <strong>Security and Risk Management</strong> module. 
            It aims to reflect on how I have applied cybersecurity frameworks, collaborated within a team, and developed essential skills 
            necessary for my future career aspirations within cybersecurity.
          </p>

          <h2>Key Strengths and Achievements</h2>
          <p>
            One of my main strengths during the module was the ability to implement frameworks such as 
            <strong>ISO 31000</strong> and the <strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)</strong> to real-world business scenarios. 
            In the <em>Pampered Pets</em> task, I made contributions to assess organisational risks, providing recommendations for the most  
            appropriate mitigation strategies. This experience has increased my awareness of how theoretical models can be implemented to significantly improve 
            business resilience and operational security.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the completion of this task I have also improved my quantitative skills by using risk evaluation tools such as the 
            <strong>Probability-Impact Matrix (PIM)</strong> and the <strong>Expected Monetary Value (EMV)</strong> model. 
            These allowed the prioritisation of risks based on their potential financial and operational impact.
          </p>

          <h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>
          <p>
            One key area for improvement is the need for 
            <strong>enhanced critical analysis</strong> For example, while I effectively used ISO 31000 
            and NIST CSF, In order to strengthen my evaluation, comparisons with other modules such as <strong>FAIR</strong> or <strong>OCTAVE</strong>. 
            May have been necessary and provided a more detailed explanation for the approach selected.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another key improvement area would be the implementation of <strong>project management features</strong> within the project. </p>
