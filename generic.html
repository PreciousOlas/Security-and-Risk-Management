										<h1>Reflection on Learning and Development</h1>
									</header>
									<p>This reflection explores tasks completed within the security and risk management module 
										and is structured using Rolfe et al.â€™s (2001) model to provide a guidance for the analysis of my experiences throughout.</p>
									
									<p> The security and risk management module has allowed me to develop a broader understanding for risk management, recognising how cybersecurity risks and operational risks are independent of each other and essential in the management of risks within a business. In the Pampered Pets task, digitalisation of the business proved to offer significant growth potential, however as a result of digitalisation, would likely introduce new vulnerabilities requiring mitigation. These would include cyber risks such as phishing and supply chain compromise (NIST, 2024). My contribution to the report focused on categorising risks within a clear framework, as well as recommendation of mitigation techniques to include staff training, secure e-commerce design and a hybrid cloud disaster recovery plan. 
One key learning outcome that was revealed in completion of the module was the application of quantitative risk analysis using the probability-impact matrix (PIM) and expected monetary value (EMV) models to a real-world application by allowing potential risks to be quantified, into measurable figures. The figures allowed comparison of which risks would present the most significant financial implications and therefore which of these would require the most essential mitigation. This task presented how essential cybersecurity is within a business model, being a necessary investment that may influence operational continuity and financial presentation (Sadgrove, 2015).
The completion of the group team project, significantly highlighted the importance of effective collaboration from all team members in order to achieve positive team outcomes. 
										The coordination of tasks between all members required consistent communication, which my team were able to successfully accomplish.
										Initially, in comparison of work completed it was clear to see that team members shared the same common ideas, in this it was not too challenging to align our ideas shared within on single documentation and we were able to achieve consistency through regular communication and collaboration of ideas. I learned that in order to achieve team outcomes, clear communication, clarity of positions within the team and respect of others ideas make for a successful outcome. The task had definitely developed my ability to show confidence to apply academic knowledge to business issues. Prior to completing the course, I estimated that it may have been challenging to apply theoretical frameworks however working through tasks made it clear that using the frameworks significantly aids the critical analysis of risk data and formulating recommendations.
The application of a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) plan into the digitalisation proposal was particularly interesting. The development of the hybrid cloud model for Pampered Pets presented how technical solutions can support business consistency while maintaining the confidentiality and availability of information. This application of business resilience principles into security management, reflected a developed understanding of holistic risk governance.
This module has significantly influenced my ability to analyse, quantify and manage risk providing skills essential to being successful within future cybersecurity roles such as Cyber security analyst- a role that I am personally working towards, as well as Governance, risk and compliance specialists. These skills gained would be advantageous when seeking to complete certifications such as the CompTIA Security+ that will strengthen my ability to apply risk frameworks into real-world applications. I will intend to further develop my understanding and awareness of risk governance frameworks in order to assess and audit security controls within professional settings. 
Skills that I feel I have developed a range of technical and analytical skills that will support my progression throughout the cybersecurity course. In creation of structured report documentations such as Pampered Pets Risk assessment and the Executive summary, I have enhanced my ability to relay technical information within a business setting. My research and report writing skills have been developed in this way. Analytical and problem- solving skills have further been developed in the use of quantitative tools that had allowed me to clearly present complex risk information and make informed decisions. In the collaboration within the team task, I developed my teamwork and communication skills. I found the importance of sharing ideas, communicating with team members effectively and taking accountability. The lessons learned within this team work task, would surely be used to know how I would present myself within a similar team project. 
Finally, this reflective task has been enlightening. Reflecting critically on my learning and outcomes has allowed me to identify areas where I consistently show strengths as well as areas required for improvement. According to Rolfe et al. (2001), reflection is a repeated cycle of learning, evaluation, and reapplication. I will intend to apply this reflective framework to my academic tasks, in order to prioritise academic growth.
